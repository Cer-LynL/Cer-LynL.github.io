<p>Monstera Deliciosa is a tropical plant from the Araceae family. Although it is native to Central and South America, it is typically grown as a houseplant.
Monstera is quite easy to take care of. You only need to make sure you follow the few requirements it has. Two most important would be giving it enough light
and also proper watering. What to bare in mind is that they tend to grow quite long. When in nature they grow up to 20 meters then indoors is luckly different,
generally between 2-3 meters. When taken good care of, Monsteras bring great joy and beauty to your home.</p>

    <th>Watering need</th>
    <th>Light need</th> 
    <th>Soil type</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Allow the soil to become dry at the top to the touch between watering and do not over watert</td>
    <td>Bright light is good but not essential</td>
    <td>Well-draining potting mix with sand</td>
  </tr>

<p>Similar to Monstera, the "ZZ plant" also comes from Central and South America. When Monstera needs watering quite often because it tends to dry out fast,
then Zanzibar can be unwatered for even months and still look amazing. It's need for sun is significantly lower as well. So all in all, if you want an
indestructible houseplant- Zanzibar Gem is the one for you!</p>
